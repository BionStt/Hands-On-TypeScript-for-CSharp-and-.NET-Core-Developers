**Explore the possibilities of C# for developing a variety of efficient applications**

## What is this book about?
When it comes to writing a clean, object-oriented code in JavaScript, it gets trickier and complex as the size of the project grows. This is where a Typescript comes into a picture with which you can write pure object-oriented code without any hustle. This gives Typescript an upper hand over JavaScript. This book starts by introducing TypeScript basic concepts by modifying gradually standard JavaScript code, which makes it easy for C# Asp.NET developers who are aiming for a transition to learning TypeScript, which they can now add to their development toolkit.

This book covers the following exciting features:
How to organize test, and package large TypeScript code bases 
How to add TypeScript to existing projects with the help of publicly available TypeScript declaration files 
How to perform DOM manipulation from TypeScript 
Develop an Angular project with Visual Studio Angular project template 
How to define and use Inheritance, abstract classes, and methods 
How to take advantage of TypeScript “more permissive” type compatibility rules. 
How to use WebPack to bundle other resources such as CSS files and images to improve performance 
How to perform advanced customization techniques by learning how to build custom directives and attributes, and how to use animations
