Create an Asp.net Core application and choose Angular template
Then, replace the ClientApp folder with the one here.
Then add the remainder of the file tree to an Asp.net core project.
Put each file in the same Asp.net core folder it is here.


The first time you load the project in Visual Studio, open
the "package.json" that is in ClientApp and save it 
without changing anything, in orger to trigger 
npm packages restore.
